# Final Exam (Part 1)

1. What key is the excerpt in?

   - E Major

2. Go to bar bar 1, second beat:  what is this chord? 

   (Remember 'a' denotes a root position chord, 'b' denotes a chord in first inversion etc. Also remember to look at both staves!).

   Tick ALL options that describe some aspect of this chord. (2 marks available)

   - The tonic chord
   - Ib

3. On bar 4, second  beat: what chord is this (hint: how is it related to the following chord)?

   Select ALL options that are appropriate. (2 marks available)

   - F#7 (F# dominant 7)
   - V7/V(V7 of V) **[why]**

4. Go to bar 8, then look at the top stave only. On the first beat, two notes are sounding: name the interval. 
   - Augmented second
5. Look at the uppermost note in on beat 2 of bar 12 (top stave): What is the enharmonic equivalent of this note?
   - G natural
6. Look at bar 12 top stave, second beat: what is this interval?

   - V/iii (the V of the iii chord)
   - D# major to G# minor
   - A perfect cadence in the relative minor of the Dominant

8. In bar 19, on the top stave there is a quintuplet. We have removed the stems and beams and left only the note heads, with the '5' symbol meaning quintuplet. Using the other notes in the bar, deduce what duration/time value this quintuplet should occupy
   - Quaver or eighth note **[why]**

9. Looking at the same quintuplet as question 9 in bar 19.  Assuming all five notes are of equal rhythmical value, how many beams do the 5 notes need?  In other words, what note values should each of the quintuplets be made of?
   - Three beams - demisemiquaver/32nd 

10. What is the first chord in bar 14? Select **ALL** **options** that could describe (or partly describe) this chord (3 marks) **[why]**

    - The dominant
    - V9b
    - Vb

    - Six semiquavers/16ths
13. Go to bar 25 (the second repeat). On beats 1 and 2: what is this chord? (On beats one and two, there are melodic lines in quavers. These notes are effectively part of the chord). Tick ALL options that describe, or partly describe this chord. (3 marks)
    - V7/V
    - F#7b9
    - F#7
