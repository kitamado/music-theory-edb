# Final exam part2

14.  Look at the first 8 bars of this piece and describe the phrase structure.
    - The “Air” is divided into two parts, both repeated; the first 8 bars ending on the dominant, and it is made up of two-bar melodic phrases.

15. Look at the 'left hand' part (i.e. the lower stave) in bar 6. Please fully describe the intervals on each beat.

    - (B F#) perfect fifth
    2. (C# E) minor third
    3. (D# F#) minor third

16. Please consider the 3rd chord in bar 1 and describe it fully. There is more than one way to answer this question so please give reasons for your answer. (HINT: look for other notes in the bar that may still be sounding with this chord).

    - In bar 1, the 3rd chord ringing is (A C# E F#). So it is a F#m7b, or we could say ii7b.

17. The chord on beat 2 of bar 2 is difficult to describe. How would you go about describing this chord? Please give reasons for your answer.

    - I see C# in the bass as a passing tone. So the ringing note is (D# F# A B), it is V7b in E major.

18. The first chord in bar 8 is an example of chromatic harmony; it's an Augmented (German) 6th chord. But what is the cadence we have at the end of this bar, and why?

    - It's a imperfect cadence. Because the ending is a V in E major. From any chord to V is known as a imperfect cadence.

19. Please fully describe the chords in bars 17-19 (inclusive)?

    - [17] I-Ic-Ic [18] V7c-V7-V7 [19] Ib-Ic-Ic

20. Please consider the final chord in Bar 34:

    (a) Describe this chord as fully as possible.

    (b) What is the progression when you consider this in relation to the next chord (note, the b# is a chromatic passing tone and can be overlooked)?

    -  (E# G# C#) is the first inversion of C# Maj
    - after Bar 34 it goes back to bar 27, whose chord is F# minor. So the progression is Vb/ii - ii.
